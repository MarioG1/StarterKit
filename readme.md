StarterKit - give items to new players.
====================================

StarterKit is plugin for the Minecraft wrapper [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) that provides a method for administrators to give items to new players automatically and seemlessly. You could use this to make your server a more welcoming place to start without running the risk of players exploiting it by claiming their kit more than once.

## Features

- Simple and easy to configure - create your ideal inventory then save it.
- Assign items by slot, including armour.
- Supports complex items such as maps. 
- Can use [any item that Bukkit supports](http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/org/bukkit/Material.html) in your kit.
- Ensures that only new players will receive the kit.

## Installation

### Ensure you are using the latest recommended build.

Before installing, you need to make sure you are running at least the latest [recommended build](http://dl.bukkit.org/latest-rb/craftbukkit.jar) for Bukkit. Support is only given for problems when using a recommended build. This does not mean that the plugin will not work on other versions of Bukkit, the likelihood is it will, but it is not supported.

### Getting Starterkit

The best way to install Starterkit is to use the [symbolic link](http://repository.james.richardson.name/symbolic/StarterKit.jar) to the latest version. This link always points to the latest version of Starterkit, so is safe to use in scripts or update plugins. Additionally you can to use the [RSS feed](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/starterkit/files.rss) provided by BukkitDev as this also includes a version changelog.
    
Alternatively [older versions](http://repository.james.richardson.name/releases/name/richardson/james/bukkit/starter-kit/) are available as well, however they are not supported. If you are forced to use an older version for whatever reason, please let me know why by [opening a issue](https://github.com/grandwazir/StarterKit/issues/new) on GitHub.

## Configuration

### Read the documentation

All documentation for Starterkit is available on the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/grandwazir/StarterKit/wiki), including [example usage](https://github.com/grandwazir/StarterKit/wiki/Instructions) and details on [how to configure](https://github.com/grandwazir/Starterkit/wiki/Permissions) the plugin.
