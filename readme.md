StarterKit - give items to new players.
====================================

StarterKit is plugin for the Minecraft wrapper [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) that provides a method for administrators to give items to new players automatically and seemlessly. You could use this to make your server a more welcoming place to start without running the risk of players exploiting it by claiming their kit more than once.

## Features

- Simple and easy to configure.
- Can use [any item that Bukkit supports](http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/org/bukkit/Material.html) in your kit.
- Ensures that only new players will receive the kit.

## Installation

### Ensure you are using the latest recommended build.

Before installing, you need to make sure you are running at least the latest [recommended build](http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/Recommended/) for Bukkit. Support is only given for problems when using a recommended build. This does not mean that the plugin will not work on other versions of Bukkit, the likelihood is it will, but it is not supported.

### Getting StarterKit

The best way to install StarterKit is to use the [static link](http://downloads.james.richardson.name/public/binaries/starterkit/StarterKit.jar) to the latest version. This link always points to the latest version of StarterKit, so is safe to use in scripts or update plugins.
    
Alternatively [older versions](http://downloads.james.richardson.name/public/binaries/starterkit/) are available as well, however they are not supported. If you are forced to use an older version for whatever reason, please let me know why by [opening a issue](https://github.com/grandwazir/StarterKit/issues/new) on GitHub.

## Configuration

1. Configure your settings (config.yml) and [create your kit](https://github.com/grandwazir/StarterKit/wiki/instructions), or alternatively use the in game commands.
3. [Configure permissions](https://github.com/grandwazir/StarterKit/wiki/permissions) if necessary.
